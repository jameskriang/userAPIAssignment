- Use visual studio to open project/solution by selecting the file **userAPI.sln**
- Click Play/Run icon at the middle top menu on visual studio to build and start application.
- Browser should automatically open the swagger of the application. Then we can proceed to test each endpoint function.
- For secret endpoint with JWT token authenication, please run command 
    ```
    dotnet user-jwts create
    ``` 
    on terminal to generate jwt token to be use for testing the endpoint.

### What's next
- Improve error handling on controller level when handling async functions and repositories level when we connect to real database.
- Common interface for database so that we can reuse for multiple business/data domain.
- Docker run verification. Currently the dockerfile is generated by IDE. I can not easily verify with my Windows machine.
- Adding Logging and request tracing/observibility.
- Text search can be improve with better/more appropiate library suite for seaching.
- Proper scope of authorization control. ex. who can listalluser, or update.
- I cut integration test out because we are using in-memory data store for demo purpose. Extending further with real database, we will need integration test and clear description on how to run/setup local integration test.
